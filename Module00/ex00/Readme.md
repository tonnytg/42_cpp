### CPP Module 00

This project is an introduction to C++.

## Exercise ex00 : Megaphone

Receive a message and using the std::cout, print it in upper case.
You need use string toupper function.

- Write class names in UpperCamelCase format. Files containing class code will
  always be named according to the class name. For instance:
  ClassName.hpp/ClassName.h, ClassName.cpp, or ClassName.tpp. Then, if you
  have a header file containing the definition of a class "BrickWall" standing for a
  brick wall, its name will be BrickWall.hpp.
- However, you can’t use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived
  forms) and Boost libraries are forbidden. The following functions are forbidden
  too: *printf(), *alloc() and free(). If you use them, your grade will be 0 and
  that’s it.
